name: adult capitulum
def: "Anterior region of the body that contains the palps, chelicerae and hypostome. Capable of dorsal to ventral flexing motion. Homologous with the gnathosoma of mites. The capitulum articulates with the body via a cavity, the camerostome. The capitulum is located at the anterior end of the body in ixodid ticks and the larvae of many argasid ticks. It is located ventrally or subterminal, obscured by an overhang of the anterior end of the body." [ISBN:0-19-505910-7]

def: "V-shaped moveable sructure (wedge) that contributes to opening and closing of the valve by fitting into the mouth at the end of the pre-oral canal, thereby opening or closing the connection to the pharynx. When the wedge is raised, the valve is opened, allowing fluid uptake. When lowered, the valve is closed by collapse of its walls and regurgitation is blocked. Opening and closing of the valve is coordinated with constriction and dilation of the pharynx to propel blood posteriorly and prevent regurgitation." [ISBN:0-19-505910-7]

Operation of the anterior pharyngeal valve is accomplished by the contractionof the dilator muscles inserted on the wing-like alae, thereby raising or lowering the v-shaped wedge. When the wedge is raised,fluid is taken up, when lowered, it projects down into the v-shaped valve, sealing it and prevents backflow." [ISBN:0-19-505910-7]

The proventriculus opens when the pharynx contracts, allowing ingested blood to enter the midgut, but closes when the pharynx dilates. The latter is believed to prevent regurgitation of blood from the midgut back into the host. However, this remains a controversial issue since some authors (e.g., Burgdorfer et al. 1989) have argued that regurgitation can occur while others (Riberio et al. 1987) consider it unlikely. Connat (1991, Parasitol. Res. 77: 452 -454) showed compelling evidence of regurgitation using tritiated ecdysteroids). Thus, it appears that there is good evidence that it can occur in argasid ticks. Whether it can also occur in ixodid ticks is uncertain." [ISBN:0-19-505910-7]

def: "A hair like process that extends from the cuticle to the exterior. The seta is the most common type of sensillum. The seta isinserted into a socket, a depression in the cuticle surrounded by a slight ridge. The interior of the seta is hollow and connected directly to a duct that extends through the cuticle to the epidermis. Several neurons embedded in the epidermis innervate the setiform sensillum, sending dendrites into the shaft of the seta. Axons from the neuron cell bodies extend into the interior of the body and communicate via nerves to the synganglion. Most setae are simple, without pores and serve as mechanosensilla and are innervated by mechanosensory neurons. Specialized setae have either single pores at the tip (gustatory sensilla), pores all over the sensilla (olfactosensilla) or pores in ridges along the side walls or with grooves that lack pores. These latter sensilla are believed to function as hygrosensilla or thermosensilla or both." [ISBN:0-19-505910-7]

The secretory cells of the LAG are filled with lipids.

According to Lees and Beament (1948), these cells produce a lipid-rich secretion which coats the eggs as they pass along the vestibular vagina during oviposition, but this could not be confirmed in later studies."

name: adult male spermatophore
def: "The spermatophore is not a permament part of the male anatomy. Rather it is formed externally from soluble proteins, lipids and other materials in a viscous droplet ejaculated by the male during copulation. These materials coagulate into the ectospermatophore that momentarily encloses the male genital aperture. This is followed quickly by masses of elongated prospermia and seminal fluids that flow into the ectospermatophore, causing it to balloon and turn opaque. Next, a second viscous droplet is introduced which forms the bilobed endospermatophore. This also seals the spermatophore. A single endospermatophore occurs in ixodid ticks, but two endospermatophores commonly occur in argasid ticks. When completed, the entire spermatophore is seized by the male's chelicerae as itemerges from the male genital aperture. Then, using its chelicerae, the male transfers the spermatophore to the female's genital aperture and implants it into the vestibular vagina. Saliva is secreted to lubricate the female's genital area to facilitate the process. Meanwhile, CO2 generated within the spermatophore creates sufficient pressure to force the masses of elongated prospermia and semen into the endospermatophore (s), which everts, expands and passes out the external spermatophore and into the female's genital tract. The ectospermatophore remains as an empty sac on the external surface of the female, where it soons dries, shrivels and falls off." [ISBN:0-19-505910-7]
