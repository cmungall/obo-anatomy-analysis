def: "Zoological Science 11\: 825-839 (1994) -   Stage 0 Unfertilized eggs\: The mature unfertilized egg is an oblate spheroid measuring average 1\,245.9 +/-3.9 um (n=122) in horizontal diameter and a little less (average 1\,169.9 +/- 4.0 um\, n=122) in vertical diameter. The egg proper is closely surrounded by a thick egg envelope\, the chorion. The perivitelline space between the chorion and the vitellus is very difficult to recognize using a light microscope. The micropyle located in the chorion at the animal pole is a small trumpet- or funnel-like structure. A number of short villi (non-attaching filaments; average 200.3 +/- 4.7 / egg\, n=38) are distributed over the whole surface of the chorion. At spawning\, eggs are held together in clumps by a tuft of long attaching filaments (average 29.6 +/- 1.3 / egg\, n=38) on the chorion surface in the vegetal pole area of each egg \[13\]. A large\, transparent yolk sphere is located in the center of each unfertilized egg. The cortical alveoli (vesicles\, ca. 0.4-45 um in diameter) and oil droplets are embedded at random in the cortical cytoplasm. The cortical alveoli contain a transparent colloidal material and usually one or sometimes a few spherical bodies \[16\]. The size of the oil droplets usually varies according to differences in the temperature during and after oocyte maturation\, in the time after ovulation and among the individual females. -  " [MFO:curators]

def: "Zoological Science 11\: 825-839 (1994) - 3 min  Stage 1 (3 min) Activated egg stage\: When an egg is stimulated by a spermatozoon arriving at the vitelline surface through the micropyle\, a transient wave of increase in cytoplasmic free calcium starts at the point of sperm attachment \[5\,33\]. The cortical alveoli in the vicinity of the micropyle also begin to break down (exocytosis of alveolar contents) about 9 sec after sperm attachment \[17\]. The wave of exocytosis begins to propagate over the whole egg surface and ends at the vegetal pole 154 sec after its beginning. As a result of the exocytosis of cortical alveoli into the narrow space between the chorion and the vitellus\, the chorion thins and hardens \[24\] as it separates from the vitellus to form a wide perivitelline space. Swollen spherical bodies secreted from the cortical alveoli are faintly visible in the perivitelline space. A transient \"contractile wave\" of cortical cytoplasmic layer follows the wave of exocytosis \[9\,15\]. Due to the oscillatory contractions following this distinct contractile wave\, the cortical cytoplasm progressively accumulates toward the animal pole to form a thick cytoplasmic layer \[1\,26\]. At 7-8 minutes after sperm entry\, the second polar body is extruded onto the surface of the cytoplasm at the center of the area where the germinal vesicle broke down during oocyte maturation. - 3 min " [MFO:curators]

Pigmentation advances around the retina\, and several melanophores occupy the dorsal wall of the viscera beneath the 1st to the 5th somites. The bulge of the liver becomes definitive in the left side of the 3rd to 4th somites. The anlage of the pancreas appears as a ventral eminence on the right side beneath and slightly anterior to the 3rd somite. Three sinuous portions of the vitelline veins consisting of the left and right ducts of Cuvier and 4 sinuous portions of the vitello-caudal vein meander on the yolk sphere. The blood cells (8.7 m in diameter) flatten slightly. The posterior of the two otoliths in each otocyst is slightly larger than the anterior. - 2 days 16 hrs " [MFO:curators]

The anlage of the pineal gland is recognized as a disc-shaped\, round structure at the dorsal surface of the 3rd ventricle. In the heart\, the sinus venosus\, atrium\, ventricle and bulbus arteriosus are differentiated. There is a large\, transparent membranous protrusion inside the outer wall and another inside the inner wall of the otic vesicle (internal ear formation). In the region posterior to the eye (where gills will form)\, a group of large hatching enzyme cells has differentiated from endodermal cells \[7\,28\]. A ventral eminence is prominent behind the otic vesicles\, and an- other eminence (the presumptive swim bladder) is discernible at the ventral side of the 3rd somite. The pectoral fin is apparent\, and membranous fins are also seen in the tail\, which has 19 somites beyond the gut tube. Guanophores begin to disperse on the dorsal surface of the body trunk. The anterior tip of the notochord is located where the branches of the dorsal aorta join. - 3 days 2 hrs " [MFO:curators]

The pronephric kidney appears as a bright structure adjacent to the 1st somite. The transparent\, colorless gallbladder first appears at the posterior region of the liver. Four transparent\, membranous protrusions (the structures of the internal ear) are recognized in the otic vesicles. The anterior region of the oral cavity is formed.
