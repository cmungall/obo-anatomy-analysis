1.fbbt.owl is the complete Drosophila anatomy ontology. 
It imports accessory relations for querying form  FBbt_helper_relations.owl.
We recommend ELK or FaCT++ for classification.  FaCT++ is slower but, unlike ELK,  allows queries using arbitrary class expressions.

2. fbbt_aux.owl is a complete set of expansions of the relations in fbbt.owl as equivalent class GCI axioms.
It imports fbbt.owl and ro.owl.  The latter import requires a web connection.
We recommend ELK for classification of this. 
Queries using abitrary class expressions require the generation of probe classes and reclassification.
